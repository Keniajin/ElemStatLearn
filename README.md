# ElemStatLearn

### Introduction

This repository contains my codes of exercises and experiments reimplementation of *Elements of Statistical Learning* in **R**.

### Prerequisites

All my code is based on the Second Edition of "Elements of Statistical Learning". More information about this book (and an electronic version) can be found [here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).

The data and some routines from this book have been bundled into an R package that can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ElemStatLearn/index.html). If you want to use the code in this repository, you should install this package in advance.
